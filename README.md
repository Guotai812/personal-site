# Personal Site

## Overview

This is my personal website, designed to serve as an **online resume** and **project showcase**. It provides an overview of my experience, projects, and a way for visitors to contact me directly.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Welcome message and a brief personal introduction.
- **Experience Page**: Displays my professional experience and background.
- **Projects Page**: Showcases projects I’ve worked on.
- **Contact Page**: A form for visitors to leave their email and message.

To make the site more flexible, such as updating my experience easily, I’ve built a separate admin project called [`personal-site-management`](https://github.com/Guotai812/personal-site-management) that allows content management.

## Tech Stack
